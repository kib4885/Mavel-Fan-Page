## **OVERVIEW**

A Marvel Fan Page.

Website was created in anticipation of Marvel's newest movie “Avengers: Endgame”.
With that in mind, we wanted to give our users a way to access character information. 
Through our site, users will be able to acquire and review character information in preparation of the movie release.

The page gives a user the ability to search any Marvel character and be able to retrieve the Character Bio, Character title movies, and Character featured and support comics.
